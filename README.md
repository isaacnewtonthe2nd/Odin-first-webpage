# Odin-first-webpage

This project is to text my skill of html and css. So far, I have learned about the HTML boiler plate, elements, tags, attributes and so on. I have also learned about css fonts, layout, margin, padding, styling, box-sizing, and most importantly css flex. 

I started this project by modeling it a an example website that was provided, but I had to be creative and fill it with my own content. I created a brand called Solace in Space, which is an home decor brand I created almost two years back. I modeled it by what a modern e-commerce online store would look like. I added some relevant pictures found on unsplash and pexels to use as content as well as doing some copywriting on the page. I made sure everything looked good on different screen size as much as I can with the little knowledge, and so far, I think it was a success.
